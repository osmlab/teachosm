[LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/) is an online, open source book designed to guide individual learners in how to 
map using the OpenStreetMap platform. Some of the material in TeachOSM was expanded and adapted from LearnOSM specifically 
for classroom use and there is enough overlap that users of TeachOSM will find it useful to refer to LearnOSM to 
augment their materials.
