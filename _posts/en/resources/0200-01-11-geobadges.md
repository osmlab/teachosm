GeoBadges - GeoBadges grants credit in the form of 'micro-credentials' for demonstrated competency in open source 
mapping techniques, including OpenStreetMap. The idea is that students can acquire different badges that demonstrate
their skill in creating quality map data. These badges can be listed on a resume or CV and, in some not-too-distant future,
count toward the service learning requirements common in many schools.
