Each of the case studies featured here showcase the use of OSM in an educational setting. Some exercises focus on remote mapping work, others work locally and feature the extensive use of [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/), a paper-based aid to collecting data outdoors. 

If you feel the exercise resonates with your personal interest, please feel free to contact the instructor(s) associated with the study for more information, or how to tailor for your event.


If you have an interesting case-study to share with the TeachOSM community, please include the following information:

1. Backstory
2. Description of the mapping challenge/task
3. Describe the workflow
4. List any issues or problems encountered
5. Discuss the results and what was learned
6. Provide contact information
