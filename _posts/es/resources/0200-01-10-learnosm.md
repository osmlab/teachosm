Learn OpenStreetMap On Your Own
=================

[LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/) is an online, open source book designed to guide individual learners in how to map using the OpenStreetMap platform. Some of the material in TeachOSM was expanded and adapted from LearnOSM specifically for classroom use and there is enough overlap that users of TeachOSM will find it useful to refer to LearnOSM to augment their materials.
